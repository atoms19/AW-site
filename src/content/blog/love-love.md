so back then when i was kid about 15 i watched doctor stone
i kinda was like senku back then science was everything and i had topped science 
so well i liked it 

but i really got hooked after watching SAO , yk what cool swords and pretty girls do to a 14year old
makes him go crazy and there i had it i was watching animes non stop 


- AOT (all except final chapter (readmanga instead i dont like the ending))
- JOJO'S bizzare adventures (all seasons)
- SAO ( all but some spin offs are missing , i really was cringe back then and liked slop)
- MHA (2 seasos i belive and rest manga)

well i have seen enough but these aint recommended 

the real recommendations are starting now , peak peak peak 
romance yk romance is supposed to be subtle and mundane these ones does it for me

- Kaguya sama Love is war ... absolute peak writing lovey dowey ,comicy fun 
- Fragrant flowers blooms with dignity ...realism is soo relaxing
- Angel Next door spoils me rotten .. cover art is from that Novel is peak dk about anime (1,2,3) volumes till confession it falls off from there
- my dress up darling  .... was peak when it peaked then boring
- Horimiya... ik this is in everyones list but ig its fun to read 
- KOmI cant communicate .... idk maybe if u like it i dont

ps i have a sweet spot for asuna and kirito even tho there romance aint muî€“ch, nostalgia maybe 

# dont ask why i have read all these
