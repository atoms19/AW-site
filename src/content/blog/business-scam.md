# Enterprenureship and engineering 

SO it has become a part of the syllabus and they are teaching us to scam people and sell false products 
in the incentive to make money , and we are too dumb 

# crazy payout and need to become rich
lets cut to the chase everyone wants an audi benz or lambo , a big mansion luxury is what we crave.
and its becoming obvious that if you crave luxury you are not getting it working a 9 to 5
Ever you wont be even getting enough for your retirement if you work a 9 to 5 job 

so they sell you this idea , to brain storm and come up with solutions to problems in society and sell it 
grow your company get investors and become rich 
is this the scam part ? no 

we need solutions to problems and people who solve them get filthy rich , ever thought what jeff bezos solved
he made it easier for us to shop not just that his company powers half of the modern web becoming backbone for so many
enterprises as AWS and for his vision and execution , i'd say such global solutions do deserve a great checkout 

mark zucc's facebook brought connections , and powered social media ,he grew his business with ads and now meta not only just powers
social platforms they do wonders in AI research and AR and VR technology 

steve jobs made apple and without apple we might have never gotten the small form factor obsession over perfect designs and much of the 
modern fetaureset we enjoy in smartphones , apple plays their game well offering services for movies , payment , music and so on 
making an ecosystem so cohesive its impossible to escape , samsung tries to do the same

founders of google larry and sergy made it easier to look for solutions in the web and google now is in forefront of machine learning and
so much more 

and the payout they recive when the sell the company is deserving of the stress and sheer innovation they bought to this 
world , this is justifyable a business man deserves a cut of the profit 

what is not justifyable is them defying taxes , using political and monetary power to shut out competition etc

# innovation should be profitable but not always

the thing about this whole entreprenureship is that they teach us to grow our company rather than provide a service 
a software company's heart and soul is the developers the programmers the designers the product designers etc ?right  ?

**NOPE**

it seems the companies these days focus a lot more on growth their marketing team and whoever is that makes deals with 
venture capitalists , they show crazy estimates and projections to secure funding and get cash flowing in 

more money more and more and more money 
ever wondered why some company out of nowhere popped up in your newspaper headline ? 
thats marketing and thats venture backed marketing some big money flowed into that unknown company with barely any userbase 
cause their team was able to pitch and convince the VCs to put in cash 

so great so you make a company you convince VCs and get things going right ??
no VCs aren't fools they are foxes they take control from you the founder and with little to no power left your company falls apart 
does shitty business to get more investors

so whats the end is this the end , whatever it is that you are providing to the socitey if you have a solution 
open source it(if you please) , make it available put a price on it 
dont focus on growth purely all that bs they thaught you in college under enterprenureship is to get investors flowing in 

you dont need VCs and to be liable to tons of investors , fund yourself find people you trust as investors and grow slowly build 
trust and connect with customers and good things take time dont rush so that you can be a millionire in 3years
its not about money its about product you deliver and the people you impact enterprenures even if they start with a good thing in mind
they'd end up charging for a software that costs them nothing to run on a monthly basis just so they could get money truly shitty behaviour 

i mean socitey is like that when you have a 9 to 5 you are seen as a no one what lots of people look past is that behind every 
successful company there are 1000s if not lakhs of engineers , CAs ,managers and workforce that work from 9 to 5 these so called entreprenures did 
not build things from scratch they hired people and people worked behind every software that we use there are tons of peoples's hard work they just dont get the 
appreciation they deserve (they are doing it for money but the money always flows up and we only hear about the ones who ordered to build the pyramid not the ones who laid the stones)

i cant bro these entreprenureship pitches and stupid presentations and all these stratagey to retain investors just to grow big fast and fast false promises underdelivered products and a quick way to wealth
such wealth do not last ,want an example byjus i believe the founder was genuine and started with the right intention then it just lost control when lots of money flew in 
was that sorta boom necessary now its broken bankrupt 

# what are you yapping lil bro ?

so at the end just do what you please just dont run behind enterprenureship bandwagon for money , have a solution for a problem 
instead of aquiring tons of funding put in some of your own sell it offer it locally act as small business and get customers
build the product refine it and then think about growing when you have enough capital 
dont chase after that initial cash flow if you do you loose your vision your product and your control in return for money and if you dont mind it being lost 

then you never cared about the customers or the product to begin with you just wanted their wallets ($_$)
