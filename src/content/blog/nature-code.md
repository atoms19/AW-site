# what is true peace

back when i was a kid back in school days back in 12th and 11th one thing i wanted was to 
make cool desktop setups with linux
and that dream came true 
crazy right how ones dream as simple as that can come true whence u work for it real cool shit
cause i was denied the right to use computers to study for enterance back then just getting hand
on one became a dream

# i love terminals
i have barely a year of experience using terminal , but dam i am on it more than 7hours a day 
so it makes sense i'd get familiar 
doing drag and drop feels like a pain now , just use terminal and remember path 
not that hard

and i bid good bye to my windows after seeing too many ads in excel,weather app and word and i moved to fedora 
before this i had installed zorin os on vbox before 
but this was the first time me getting handy inside the dual boot , BIOS menu and god it was 
scary but i got familiar with it and 

i love fedora , stable os doesnt break ,optional updates , yk i am a lazy guy and to avoid somethign 
in the way i go over and beyond ,

just like why i built this blog site cause i was too lazy to sign into my dev.to to get hit by ads
ads seems like a common enemy to me , so i left fedora for arch only cause people had this notion arch is for godly 
cs nerds and me being a self proclaimed godly cs nerd decided to install it 
it went well oneshotted it , within 2 hours i belive well in a vm 
i did 3 installs before i try it with actual computer 
and tripple booted my device 

# moving to arch 
arch ran as a test run for several months entirety of second semester perhaps
did i ran to major issues yes
obv arch is a distro ,its like a house u build u get the foundation rest of it is upto you to build 
so much work 

and i did that bit by bit
installig zsh 
adding a window manager
configuring it 
configuring the taskbar (waybar)
adding browser , file manager everything 
even security is in your hands

after several weeks my distro broke and i had to chroot into fix it ,obv felt ultra cool after i regenerated 
initramfs and reinstalled grub and made it work 

crazy it bricked itself by not having enough juice while an update
anyways that aside i was still dailying fedora for daily tasks back then 
i had issues with pulseaudio messing up playback

# fixing arch 

i fixed audio issues by moving to pipewire , and updating my browser 
etc audio fix alone was kinda difficult after that i ditched hyperland 
for sway 

not a choice ,it was a choice based on ideology i like minimalism and stability 
and arch was becoming stable 
and i was liking it 

obv imported my neovim (neovim story is worht another post so more on that later)
and finally felt at ease with a good config i can code fast 
and reliably

is this peak autism ??? kinda is nobody aint spending hours configuring your pc and making
a ridiculous script in c that picks random waifus to display on terminal (T-T)-/
but there are such folks out there ; )
